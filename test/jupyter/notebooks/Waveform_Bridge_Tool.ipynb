    "# Waveform Manager Bridge Validation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Background**</u>: \n",
    "* The Waveform Manager Service provides HTTP endpoints used to query for calibrated waveform channel segments. Waveform Manager Service uses the Waveform bridge component to query wfdisc records and .w files from an Oracle database, translates that data from the legacy CSS data model to the GMS waveform channel segment COI, and returns JSON formatted results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**What this tool does**</u>: \n",
    "* Validates that data acquired via the Waveform Manager Services matches the expected results from the database tables\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Important Notes**</u>: \n",
    "* REMEMBER to generalize the dbinfo variable with database information before committing  or sending externally;\n",
    "  REMOVE password and db specific information. Efforts will be made in next version to transition to use an Oracle \n",
    "  wallet so this step will no longer be necessary.\n",
    "* Requires obtaining information from WFDISC.dir and WFDISC.dfile to grab relevant .w files. Ideally should be\n",
    "  able to use wpath variable externally \n",
    "    * Before committing or sending externally, remove the real_wpath variable  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Currently the Waveform Manager has two types of OSD endpoints available**</u>:\n",
    "* Retrieve by list of channel names, time range, and optional faceting definition (waveform/channel-segment/query/channel-timerange)\n",
    "* Retrieve by collection of ChannelSegmentDescriptors and optional faceting definition (waveform/channel-segment/query/channel-segment-descriptors)\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>**Objects available for retrieval from Waveform Manager Service**</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Channel Segments**\n",
    "   * Channel-timerange endpoint: \n",
    "     * Using a list of channels, start time, end time, and optionally a faceting definition returns a collection\n",
    "       of calibrated channel segment waveforms with channels populated as version references. Time range is \n",
    "       inclusive and returns all samples requested by user regardless of which files they came from. Children are \n",
    "       returned based on the provided faceting definition.\n",
    "   * Channel-segment-descriptors: \n",
    "     * Using a collection of ChannelSegmentDescriptors (channel name, segment start time, segment end time, and \n",
    "       segment creation time), and optionally a faceting definition, returns a colletion of calibrated channel\n",
    "       segment waveforms with channels populated as version references. Time range is inclusive and returns all \n",
    "       samples requested by user regardless of which files they came from. Children are returned based on the\n",
    "       provided faceting definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Known issues**:</u> \n",
    "   * Channel segment descriptor endpoint will not work until cache reintegrated into Station Definition Bridge \n",
    "   * Potentially an issue with how the waveform bridge handles gappy/overlapping data (under investigation)\n",
    "   * Waveforms are being incorrectly broken into different timeseries when they should be merged into a single\n",
    "     time series that is as long as possible when the sample rate hasn't changed and there aren't any gaps \n",
    "     (e.g., BDFB.BDFB.BH1)\n",
    "   * Waveform brige is not properly handling channel versioning as it needs to include all channel versions and \n",
    "     their corresponding time series that existing within the queried time range\n",
    "        * Notebook currently handles expected results as if versioning were implemented and this is why we will\n",
    "          currently see differences in the output from the database vs. the output of the service endpoint. \n",
    "        * Notebook may require some tweaks when versioning implemented \n",
    "   * More than one waveform being displayed for raw waveforms (e.g., JAY, BELG, MA2) in the UI; overlapping in\n",
    "     time but not identical sample (under investigation)"
